                            <p>The tool works by generating a hash from your intimate image(s)/video(s). Image hashing
                                is the process of using an algorithm to assign a unique hash value to an image.
                                Duplicate copies of the image all have the exact same hash value. For this reason, it is
                                sometimes referred to as a 'digital fingerprint'. SafeHer India then shares the hash with
                                participating companies so they can help detect and remove the images from being shared
                                online.</p>

                            <p>A digital fingerprint – or a hash as it is technically known – is like a barcode that is
                                attached to an image/video when put through our technology. The hash is then stored in
                                the SafeHer India bank and shared with partner platforms. Hashes are then compared to
                                every image uploaded to a partner platform and if it matches, the image is removed.
                                Algorithms we use are PDQ/PhotoDNA for photos and MD5 for videos. They are open-sourced
                                and are industry standard for applications like ours.</p>
